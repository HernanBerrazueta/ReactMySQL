First of all you need to create a database called "test" ob mysql and also a table inside of it called "users" and add some items there with the attributes of id, name, age, phone, address, city, country.

After downloading the project you need to do the next steps on the terminal.

On the backend:

1. npm install
2. npm start

On the frontend:

1. npm install
2. npm run dev

Then open on your browser the url to see the json data file:
http://localhost:3001/users

and also to see on a React App the local url that gives the terminal after doing the command "npm run dev". It should be a link like this one:
http://127.0.0.1:5173/
